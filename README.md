#### Prerequisite:

1. ##### Secret generation

   In order to run the application, you will need to generate a secret key using the following command:\
   `bash python -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex())'`
   Make sure you save this key somewhere temporarily!

2. ##### Store the secret as an environment variable

   Then you need to assign that value to `RUSTY_CAULDRON_KEY` environment variable:\
   `Linux or Mac`
   Open one of the following files in your `HOME` directory:\
   `~/.bashrc", "~/.bash_profile", "~/.profile", "~/.zshrc"`
   Add the following statement at the end of the file, where `MY_GENERATED_SECRET` is the secret generated in one of the previous steps:\
   `RUSTY_CAULDRON_KEY=MY_GENERATED_SECRET`

3. ##### Database
   ##### Create the database:
   In order to create the database run the following command in the project folder:\
   `bash python ./bootstrap_database.py`
   ##### Delete the database:
   If you messed up the database, you can always delete it by running following command in the project folder:\
   To remove the database run the following command in the project folder:\
   `bash rm ./bootstrap_database.py`
